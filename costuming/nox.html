                                <p style="margin-top: 0">I created the design for this costume after receiving my role for a murder mystery party being held by Lafayette College's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lafayette_trap_floor/">Tabletop Roleplaying Appreciation Program</a>. I was going to be the murderer, a fairy named Nox.</p>
                                <p>Based on my character sheet, I knew I needed my character to have a very poised, regal appearance. I also knew I needed to come across as somewhat odd, as there were only a few other fairy characters that were going to be there. When designing, I also knew that I wanted to create or source pieces which I could reuse for my <a href="st-devonian.html">"Saint Devonian"</a> costume that I was going to wear to attend the PA Renaissance Faire a few months later. This is why I decided to give Nox a hood, as that was already a part of the concepts I had created for Saint Devonian.</p>

The hood and shirt were both made from cotton jersey, because it was rather soft and flexible, and they were machine-sewn.</p>
                                <p>The cowl was made using a pattern by <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1180196569/joan-of-arc-balaclava-sewing-pattern-pdf">Arlette Patterns</a>. I originally made the smaller version of the pattern, but when I tried it on it was far too small, so I had to remake it in a larger size.</p>
                                <p>The shirt was made using the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1183890921/women-puffed-sleeve-shirt-sewing-pattern">Ginger Top</a> pattern by Hecho Con Amor. I used the bishop sleeve style of the pattern, with gathers around the cuffs. I used a blue thread for most of the shirt that was the same color as the fabric, except for the hem at the bottom, which was done in gold.</p>
                                <p>For this costume, I also made custom 'shoelaces' for my boots, as well as two shorter ties to hike up my skirt. I did this by cutting long strips of the same blue jersey I used for the shirt. I then sewed the ends of these strips and wrapped them with gold thread as makeshift aglets.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 0">Because I was wearing a hood, I didn't really need to do anything to my hair. I pinned it back with a bobby pin and put on the hood, which I pulled back from my face to do my makeup. When I put the hood back on, it was slightly lumpy over my hair, and the spot where the bobby pin was slightly visible, so I knew that, for <a href="st-devonian.html#makeup">"Saint Devonian"</a>, I would need to do something with my hair to prevent it from being so lumpy.</p>
                                <p>When making my design drawing, I struggled to figure out what lipstick I wanted to wear with it. I had four options: red lipstick, a reddish-purple lipstick (which I could do in two different styles), and a black lipstick. I eventually decided on the black lipstick. I put on a lighter foundation, and used water-activated eyeliner to create the blue and purple shapes. The faded sections were done with blue eyeshadow. The white marks are pearls (also visible in the photograph of the costume in the sidebar). The finishing touch was a light pink blush.</p>
