                                <p style="margin-top: 0">The first sketch for this costume was made in the fall of 2023. The original idea was based on the following questions:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>What if fish could be Catholic?</li>
                                    <li>What saints would a Catholic fish pray to?</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The original idea was inspired by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/greedy.peasant/">Greedy Peasant</a>'s St. Bartholomew costume (see sidebar). I had the idea to attach the halo to the back of my head with snaps sewn onto the cowl. I also wanted to embroider different animals from illuminated manuscripts and Hieronimous Bosch paintings on the tunic and the hem of my skirt. I also wanted to wear yellow rain boots, as I felt that it was a classic part of a fisherman costume.</p>
                                <p>I'm not sure exactly what material the halo was originally going to be made from, but I believe I intended to hand paint the designs. I also wanted to include fishing lures hanging from the back of it.</p>
                                <p>One of the things I really wanted to include was the Rusty Lake fish. The fish appears in various forms in different games and short films by the company, but the version I'm particularly fond of is what I call the "Leg Fish" (see sidebar), which appears in a single puzzle in <em>Cube Escape: Harvey's Box</em>. In my initial sketch, my plan was to embroider it on one of the arms of the tunic.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 0">In the spring of 2024, I planned to participate in a murder mystery party. The theme of the party was going to be fantasy, so I decided to take the opportunity to create costume parts which I could then re-use for the "Saint Devonian" costume. This resulted in a slight re-design of my ideas (left). I found a pattern for a turtleneck shirt with bishop sleeves and a medieval style hood, both of which I machine-sewed using cotton jersey. I go more into the process of creating these two pieces on the page for the <a href="nox.html#creation">"Nox"</a> costume.</p>
                                <p>The other pieces I created for this costume were the belt, the net, the halo, and the stole (which I forgot at home and therefore does not appear in any photos of me wearing the costume). The halo I designed on Canva, then printed and glued onto two circular cardboard cake stands, which I then glued together with a rare earth magnet between them. I painted over the yellow parts of the two images with gold paint to add a more "blessed" feel to them. I then attached magnets to hair clips which allowed the halo to be stuck to the back of my head. This was rather percarious, though, so I took off the halo when we weren't taking photos.</p>

                                <div class="img-divider" style="justify-content: left; width: 100%; padding-left: 0">

                                        <p>The net was made using a light-weight white acrylic yarn. The net was crocheted with no pattern, simply measurements for how wide and long I wanted it to be. Once it was done, I blocked it, using clips to weigh down the bottom so that that net pattern was more noticable. The belt was a simple braid made from a thicker white string, which I then looked pieces of stretchy plastic bracelet line through to attach the fish. The fish were made using extra fabric from the stole, which I cut using a simple pattern I made, then hand-sewed and stuffed with a small bit of poly fill. The plastic line was inserted and sewed into the fish, which I strung with beads and fish hooks made out of soda can tabs beforehand. I also made a larger fish which attached to my cane with the same plastic line and a barrel clasp.</p>

                                <p>The stole was made using a pattern that I drafted myself. I used some cheap blue fabric, which I hemmed using gold thread. Because I wanted to include the "Leg Fish" from Rusty Lake, I had to come up with an appropriate companion for it to depict on the opposite side of the stole. This resulted in the "Face Fish" (left). Both were painted onto the stole using acrylic paint. Once it had dried, I used a simple stitch to outline them and add the face and fine details. This was done using gold thread.</p>
                                <p>The final item made for the costume was a necklace made with glass beads and the same fish hooks made of soda can tabs. I made two of these, as I wanted them to match the costume of a friend of mine. The necklaces were strung on some of the leftover yarn from the netting and used barrel clasps for closures.</p>
                                <p>The costume pieces which I did not make were the blue harem pants and the yellow rain boots, which I sourced. I had originally planned to wear a skirt, but decided that it wouldn't create the same look that I was aiming for."

                                <p style="margin-top: 0">The day before the Renaissance Faire, I did a makeup test to make sure I had the exact look that I wanted. Originally, I had wanted a scale pattern on my cheeks in eyeshadow, but I realized that that might look a bit busy. Instead, I used white foundation to create a sun pattern between my eyebrows, and to cover my eyelids and the bridge of my nose. The sun I filled in with gold eyeshadow, and I crinkled up my nose to create the patchy effect with the same eyeshadow. The rest was done with blue eyeshadow.</p>
                                <p>Because my hair is pretty thick, I used hair gel and a comb to get the front and sides flat enough that they wouldn't make the hood look lumpy (an issue I had with the <a href="nox.html#makeup">"Nox"</a> costume). I then cliped the barettes with magnets to the back of my head under the hood to attach the halo to for photos.</p>
