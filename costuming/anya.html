It would be very easy to source all of the costume items, but for a truly 'accurate' costume, I would need to have the logo of the company that Anya works for, the Pony Express, on my coveralls. I decided to make a custom patch of the logo, using cross-stitch to evoke the pixelated appearance of the source material. There wasn't any pixel art of the logo I could find, so I made it myself, leaving spots open so I would know where to do only partial stitches, preserving the curved parts of the horseshoe.</p>

I made the patch separately, but only did the black stitches in one direction. I then finished the cross-stitch by sewing it onto the breastpocket, adding a golden border to hide the parts of the patch fabric I wasn't able to completely cut away.</p>
                                <p>Because the rest of the costume was sourced, I didn't make much else to include. I printed out a copy of Anya's ID card, which I put on my keychain over my own ID card, which was used to tap in and out of my college dorm. I also got an old pill bottle and put mouthwash and a small plastic baby in it as a prop, and emptied a bottle of Listerene then filled it with something I could drink as a second prop for photos.</p>
