I was initially inspired by a stuffed bear I have named Cuddlekins (see sidebar). While I was nervous about including her in my costume, I did think about making my own version of her so that I could include it in the costume.</p>
                                <p>Based on this inspiration, I decided that the character I wanted to aim for was someone who makes living creatures akin to Cuddlekinsâ€“Frankenstein-like creatures made out of stuffed animals, dolls, and scrap fabric. This idea would require reusing clothing and fabric I already had, or buying clothing with the sole purpose of destroying it.</p>

I used a faux fur infinity scarf and gray flannel. The scraps from the project were saved, and later used in the creation of the tunic.</p>

                                        <p style="margin-top: 0">Before I sewed the fabric together, I needed to figure out exactly how much I would need. I created a pattern based off of various free patterns I found online. Once I head the measurements, I sewed together enough fabric scraps to cut out the pattern and sew together the tunic. I used some scrap tweed to line the collar, which I hand-sewed on with red embroidery thread. The rest of the tunic was machine-sewn.</p>
                                        <p>The gloves and the belt I crocheted using ombre-green acrylic yarn. I didn't use a pattern for the gloves. The belt was made using the wrap waist belt pattern by <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/923099809/pattern-crochet-wrap-waist-belt">Stone Sparrow Threads</a>. It closed in the back with a large yellow sunflower button and a loop of yarn. I then attached several buttons, charms, and other items. Because my pants didn't have pockets, I also attached a removable leather pouch which I already owned, which I used to hold my phone and wallet. Also attached was a headless Barbie left over from another art project, a tape measure, small scissors, and my crochet hook.</p>
                                        <p>The pants were made using a pair of green skinny jeans and a green dress shirt, which I cut and sewed together using a pattern for harem pants I found on <a href="https://my-dreamy-world-by-jarka.blogspot.com/2011/10/harem-pants-pattern.html">Blogspot</a>. The pants were hand-sewn, with a crochet granny square sewn onto the knee. I had a second granny square attached to twine which I tied around the opposite knee.</p>

                                <p>Because I was going to be on my feet for a while, I knew that I was going to have to bring my cane with me. To make it cohesive with my costume, I took long strips of the leftover fabric from the tunic, was well as random ribbons and crochet chains that I had around, and I tied them to the top of my cane as decoration.</p>

                                <p style="padding-top: 0">The makeup for the "Doll Necromancer" was pretty straight forward. I used white foundation and translucent setting powder to cover my face, and 24hr liquid red lipstick. I had on eyeliner and mascara as well, but because we were outside all day, I didn't take off my sunglasses very often. The intention was to make myself look like a doll. I also painted my finger and toe nails, using different colors for each to keep the "patchwork" look.</p>
                                <p>Like the makeup, the hair was also straight forward. I divided the longer part of my hair into four sections, which I put into pigtails. I then put four mismatched barrettes in my hair.</p>
