I was initially inspired by a stuffed bear I have named Cuddlekins (see sidebar). While I was nervous about including her in my costume, I did think about making my own version of her so that I could include it in the costume.</p>
                                <p>Based on this inspiration, I decided that the character I wanted to aim for was someone who makes living creatures akin to Cuddlekinsâ€“Frankenstein-like creatures made out of stuffed animals, dolls, and scrap fabric. This idea would require reusing clothing and fabric I already had, or buying clothing with the sole purpose of destroying it.</p>
