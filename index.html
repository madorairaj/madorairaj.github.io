                        <p>"How To Train Up A Child: Rationalizations for Child Abuse in Fundamentalist Christianity and Its Effects on Survivors", 2024</p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 10px">Christian fundamentalists like the Duggar family have been in the American public conciousness for decades at this point, but it wasn't until very recently that many people have gotten an understanding of what it was actually like to grow up in that sort of environment. Within the Duggars' belief system, children are obligated to obey their parents unconditionally, which can result in abuse and exploitation that is deeply interconnected with what they understand Christianity to be. This can result in trauma that influences the way that an individual relates to Christianity, God, and religion when they enter adulthood, and have to make their own decisions about what they believe.</p>

                        <h1>Costuming</h1>
                        <p>I've always enjoyed costuming, though I don't have any professional or academic experience in it. All of my costumes I've designed by myself, usually for Halloween or to attend the Renaissance Faire. While most of them are composed of sourced clothing and simple makeup, I have experience with more complicated makeup looks, sewing (both with a machine and by hand), embroidery, cross-stitch, crochet, and pattern-making.</p>
