                        <p>This paper was written as a part of my Religious Studies capstone. Along with this paper, I also completed a presentation and four art pieces related to the topics of religion, child abuse, and conservative American politics.</p>
                        <p>My research for "How To Train Up A Child" was originally focused on the Duggar family, whose story I discuss in the Introduction. Very quickly, however, it turned into looking at the ways that religion within the Duggars' specific brand of Christianity influences how children (especially girls) are treated, and what is an isn't considered proper parenting. I also wanted to look at the ways that the conflation of abuse and religion affects the ways that adults who grow up in conservative Christian groups think about God and religion.</p>
