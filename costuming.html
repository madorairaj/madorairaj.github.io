                                <p>My first costume project, worn for Halloween of 2022. The character, Valdemar, is one of the antagonists of a mobile game called <em>The Arcana</em>. The headdress was paper mach√© and medical gauze. All other items were sourced.</p>

                                <p>This costume was put together for an event for Lafayette College sophomores called "Midway Masquerade". The original headdress idea was going to be a large-scale fabrication, but I ended up using a less-complicated one that I had used for other costumes in the past.</p>
                                <p>The skirt, top, tights, boots, and accessories were sourced, but the train and mask I made myself. The mask is a simple plastic mask covered in several layers of tulle, and the train is a large piece of fabric with small weights hand-sewn into the corners to keep it from flying around too much in the wind.</p>

                                <p>One of my more intricate costumes, majority of the pieces for the "Doll Necromancer" were custom-made. The gloves and belt I crocheted and the pants I hand-sewed. The tunic, made of scrap fabric I machine-sewed together, was made using a pattern that I created myself. The fur hood I also machine-sewed, but it was several years before as an unrelated project.</p>

                                <p>One of the clubs on the the Lafayette College campus has a murder mystery party every year, and this was the costume I wore to play the murderer. Each group is assigned a color, and I requested to be in the "blue" group (fairies) so that I could make costume pieces to reuse for my Renaissance Faire costume later in the year. Both the tunic and cowl I machine-sewed using patterns I found online, while the rest of the items in the costume were sourced.</p>

                                <p>This costume was originally made to attend the PA Renaissance Faire in October 2024. The shirt and cowl from the "Nox" costume were reused, and I crocheted the netting, hand-braided the belt, and sewed and painted a stole (not pictured). I also made a necklace which matched with another one I made for my friend. All other items were sourced.</p>

All of my designs are drawn digitally.</p>
